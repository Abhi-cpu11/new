          <p>
            In Naawi-Oodena, housing has meaning. It’s not just a bunch of
            buildings/homes slapped together. This place feels like "home".
            You’ve got a solid mix of homes depending on how you live. There are
            quiet streets with family houses, there are also mid-rise
            apartments, and stacked townhomes that still feel like they belong
            to the land/comminity. Whether it’s elders, young adults, families,
            or someone just starting out, everyone has a space here. You’re not
            boxed or isolated. It’s open, walkable, and everywhere you go,
            you’re surrounded by nature. That makes a difference in your day to
            day life.

            This is where Naawi-Oodena shows who their indentity as a culture.
            The community spaces aren't just parks. They’re built with meaning.
            You’ll find paths that cut through natural areas, mirrored ponds
            that freeze in winter, fire pits, spaces for ceremony, and quiet
            corners where people go to reflect. Native plants fill the
            landscape. First Nations art is part of everything. The design makes
            it easy to be outside and feel connected to the land. It’s a place
            that works year-round. People don’t just pass through they gather,
            they laugh, they remember. It feels like dopamine here.

          <p>
            Naawi-Oodena was made for movement. It doesn’t matter the season.
            There’s always something going on. You’ve got sports fields, rec
            centers, outdoor courts, and big open parks. In the winter, those
            ponds turn into skating rinks ensuring there is seasonal
            consideration. In the summer, they’re full of life. There’s a plan
            for a huge powwow arbour (traditional Indigenous gatherings) to do
            something big enough for the whole community and more. This isn’t
            about just staying fit. It’s about people getting together, staying
            healthy, and keeping the energy of the place flowing. Whether you’re
            into sports or just want to be out and moving, you’re good.

          <p>
            The village core is where it all comes together. It’s the heart of
            the place. You can live here, eat here, shop, hang out, see art, and
            go to events, all within walking distance. The streets are built for
            people, not cars. You’ve got homes on top of businesses, wide
            sidewalks, outdoor seating, public art, and everything is done with
            culture in mind.It’s chill and designed to feel good. There’s even
            space for a future transit hub. Whether you live in this part or
            not, you’re probably going to end up here just to feel that pulse.
