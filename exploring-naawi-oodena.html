          <p>
            In Naawi-Oodena, housing actually means something. It’s not just a
            bunch of buildings stacked together. This place feels like home.
            You’ve got a solid mix of homes depending on how you live. There are
            quiet streets with family houses, and there are also mid-rise
            apartments and stacked townhomes that still feel like they belong to
            the land. Whether it’s elders, young adults, families, or someone
            just starting out, everyone has a space here. You’re not boxed in.
            It’s open, walkable, and everywhere you go, you’re surrounded by
            nature. That makes a difference. Even right in the city, it feels
            calm and grounded.

          <p>
            This is where Naawi-Oodena really shows who it is. The community
            spaces aren't just parks. They’re built with meaning. You’ll find
            paths that cut through natural areas, mirrored ponds that freeze in
            winter, fire pits, spaces for ceremony, and quiet corners where
            people go to reflect. Native plants fill the landscape. First
            Nations art is part of everything. The design makes it easy to be
            outside and feel connected to the land. It’s a place that works
            year-round. People don’t just pass through they gather, they laugh,
            they remember. It feels good here. Feels like something real.

          <p>
            Naawi-Oodena was made for movement. It doesn’t matter the season.
            There’s always something going on. You’ve got sports fields, rec
            centers, outdoor courts, and big open parks. In the winter, those
            ponds turn into skating rinks. In the summer, they’re full of life.
            There’s a plan for a huge powwow arbour (traditional Indigenous
            gatherings) too something big enough for the whole community and
            more. This isn’t about just staying fit. It’s about people getting
            together, staying healthy, and keeping the energy of the place
            flowing. Whether you’re into sports or just want to be out and
            moving, you’re covered.

          <h3>Mixed-Use Village</h3>
          <!-- Card description paragraph -->
          <p>
            The village core is where it all comes together. It’s the heart of
            the place. You can live here, eat here, shop, hang out, see art, and
            go to events, all within walking distance. The streets are built for
            people, not cars. You’ve got homes on top of businesses, wide
            sidewalks, outdoor seating, public art, and everything is done with
            culture in mind. It’s not crowded or chaotic. It’s chill and
            designed to feel good. There’s even space for a future transit hub.
            Whether you live in this part or not, you’re probably going to end
            up here just to feel that pulse.
