          <h3>Nightlife</h3>
          <p>
            When the sun goes down, Naawi-Oodena doesn’t sleep. It glows. The
            nightlife is different here. It’s not clubs and chaos. It’s
            community. You’ve got rooftop patios, outdoor music spots, night
            markets with Indigenous food, and cafés hosting open mic nights.
            Some nights you hear drumming. Some nights it’s just calm voices
            around a fire. It’s safe. It’s lit up. And it feels alive without
            being loud. The night in Naawi-Oodena has its own rhythm. It’s about
            being together, celebrating culture, and letting the place breathe
            after dark. No pressure. Just vibes.

          <h3>Cultural Campus and Education</h3>
          <p>
            This part of Naawi-Oodena is all about learning and legacy. It’s
            where education and culture connect. You’ve got schools, museums,
            art galleries, and a center for Treaty One governance all in one
            place. This is where stories get passed down. Where language,
            ceremony, and identity are built into the walls. It doesn’t feel
            like a regular campus. It feels alive. Every corner has meaning.
            From the art on the buildings to the way the spaces are set up for
            gathering, it’s built for the future but grounded in the past.
            People don’t just come here to learn. They come to grow.

          <h3>Commercial Mixed-Use</h3>
          <p>
            This part of Naawi-Oodena has a different kind of energy. It’s not
            just stores and office buildings. It’s a place where things happen.
            Indigenous-owned shops, local cafés, wellness spaces, creative
            studios, even some big stores mixed in — it all fits together. The
            buildings are made to bring people in. Wide sidewalks, space to sit
            and chill, room for patios. You can live upstairs and run a business
            downstairs. You can grab lunch, meet someone for coffee, or just
            walk through and feel like you're part of something. It’s more than
            just convenience. It’s about creating an economy that reflects
            culture and pride.
